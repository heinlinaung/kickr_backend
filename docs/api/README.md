# KickR API docs (for the Flutter app)

Integration guides written against the **live** API — every request/response shown was captured from a real call, not from source reading.

| Doc | Covers |
|---|---|
| [auth-api.md](./auth-api.md) | Signup (incl. the optional `name`), login, **refresh**, forgot/reset password. Token storage and the 401→refresh→retry loop. |
| [groups-and-locations-api.md](./groups-and-locations-api.md) | Locations (venues) and Groups (fields, `country`/`city`, images, rules, members/roles, search, QR invites, joining). |
| [admin-api.md](./admin-api.md) | **Back-office only** — force-add users to a group or event behind the `x-admin-key` shared secret. Not for the mobile app. |

**Live reference while the server is running:** Swagger UI at `/api-docs`, OpenAPI JSON at `/api-docs-json`.

## ⚠️ Breaking change — 2026-08-03

**Joining by invite code / QR now requires owner approval.** It used to add the user immediately.

`POST /groups/join-by-code` returns `status: "pending"`; the user is **not** a member until an owner/admin approves. A build that navigates into the group on success will drop the user into a group they haven't joined, and every member-only call will `403`. See [groups-and-locations-api §3.6](./groups-and-locations-api.md).

Same release: `GET /groups/:id/qr` is now open to any authenticated user, `GET /groups/:id` returns the caller's `userRole`/`memberStatus`, team rules lost their max-3 cap (and preserve newlines), and groups gained optional `country`/`city`.

## Read this first

Two conventions apply to every endpoint in the auth and groups docs:

1. **Success responses are wrapped in `data`**; error responses are **flat**, and `message` may be a **string or a list of strings**.
2. **Send the Cognito `accessToken`** as `Authorization: Bearer …` — the `idToken` is rejected with `401`.

The admin doc shares convention 1 but **not** 2 — it authenticates with the `x-admin-key` header instead of a user token.

Each doc ends with a **gotchas checklist** and a **"not built yet"** section, so the app isn't designed against unimplemented features.
